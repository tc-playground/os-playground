# Introduction to OS, its Roles & Types

## Notes

1. __Operating Systems__

    1. Provide `hardware abstractions` over hardware to present a `virtualized` views of the hardware resources.

        1. __Easy to program__ - Programs do not need to know about the nitty gritty details of the hardware.

        2. __Reusable Functionality__ - Programs can reuse the OS functionality.

        3. __Portable__ - OS interfaces are consistent and do not need to change when the hardware changes.

   2. Implement a `resource manager` over hardware resources so they can be safely `isolated` and `shared`.

        1. __Sharing__ - Allows sharing of hardware between multiple programs.

        2. __Isolation__ - Protects programs from each other.

        3. __Performance__ - Provides efficient utilisation of resources.

2. __Types of Operating System__

   1. __Embedded OS__ - Contiki OS.

   2. __Mobile OS__ - Android OS, iOS.

   3. __Real Time OS__ - QNX, VxWroks, RTLinux.

   4. __Secure OS__ - SeLinux, SeL4.

   5. __Server OS__ - Redhat, Debian, Windows Server.

   6. __Desktop OS__ - Mac OSX, Windows, Chromium.
